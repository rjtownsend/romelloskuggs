# ROMELLO SKUGGS

## A starter website for Drupal 8 Developers

Installs and configures core and contrib modules plus the [bootstrap_sass](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap_sass) theme.
Project goal is to provide a starter website for developers and site-builders similar to a starter theme 
for front-end developers.

Full instructions for installing a bootstrap\_sass subtheme can be found here: https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap_sass

The [Romello Skuggs Installer](https://github.com/rjtownsend/romelloskuggs-installer) project provides a base `composer.json` installation file
that can be used in tandem with this install profile. See the project page for details.
